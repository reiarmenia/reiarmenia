ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹Hello!

My name is Rei Armenia (@reiarmenia). My pronouns are They/Them.

I'm a developer for the state of New York, and this is my professional/work account. I'm a full stack developer but currently I'm more focused on Front-End especially in javascript frameworks like Angular/React.


My languages of choice are: C#, Java, Python and TypeScript (Not in any particular order).

I am currently learning Svelte/Sveltekit.
